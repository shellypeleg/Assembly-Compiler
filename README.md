# Assembly-Compiler
This project is a final project in C class, at the Open University of Israel. 
Our project receives simple programs written in a basic assembly language (configured for this project only) and converts each row into a pattern of bits, simulating an assembler. 
The pattern of bits is presented in the output files in a strange 32 base letters:  ! @ # $ % ^ &amp; * &lt; > a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v . 
Each row in the output files contains the address &amp; encoding for the assembly instructions, in this 32 base.
